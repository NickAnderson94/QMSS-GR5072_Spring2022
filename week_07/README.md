## Week 7: Functions IV - strings and dates

### Before class...

1. **install** [`stringr`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/stringr/index.html), [`rebus`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rebus/index.html), and [`lubridate`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lubridate/index.html) packages
2. **read** Chapters 14 ([Strings](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/strings.html)) & 16 ([Dates and Times](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/dates-and-times.html)) in [**R for Data Science**](https://r4ds.had.co.nz)


#### Advanced topics (to explore on your own)

*  Some good resources to get you started with **text as data**, which is the next-level use of your string manipulation skills
	* [**Text as Data: The Promise and Pitfalls of Automatic Content Analysis Methods for Political Texts**](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/political-analysis/article/text-as-data-the-promise-and-pitfalls-of-automatic-content-analysis-methods-for-political-texts/F7AAC8B2909441603FEB25C156448F20) gives a state-of-the-art review (*circa* 2013) of text as data in the social sciences. (A bit outdated but still a great introduction)
	* [**Text Mining with R: a tidy approach**](https://www.tidytextmining.com) gives a book-length introduction to text as data in R
* Some very useful packages to work with text
	* the [`quanteda` package](https://quanteda.io)
	* the [`tm` package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tm/index.html)
