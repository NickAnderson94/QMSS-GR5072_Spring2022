## Week 4: Functions I - their structure and logic

### Before class...

1. read
	* Chapter 6, [__Functions__](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/functions.html) in [__Advanced R__](https://adv-r.hadley.nz)
	* [Syntax](https://style.tidyverse.org/syntax.html) and [Functions](https://style.tidyverse.org/functions.html) sections on the [__the `tidyverse` style guide__](https://style.tidyverse.org)


#### Advanced topics (to explore on your own)

* [Environments](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Environments.html) in [__Advanced R__](http://adv-r.had.co.nz) to learn more about how to call them, how to create new environments, how to  look up their content, and how to define the search path of a scoping operation
* [A Tutorial on Loops in R - Usage and Alternatives](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/tutorial-on-loops-in-r) to learn more about other types of operators - `while` and `repeat` - to use instead of `for` loops
* the [`(...)` ](https://github.com/lcolladotor/dots) argument to learn how to hide additional arguments for advanced users of a function

* [Custom functions](https://bookdown.org/ndphillips/YaRrr/functions.html) and [Loops](https://bookdown.org/ndphillips/YaRrr/loops.html) chapters in [__YaRrr! The Pirateâ€™s Guide to R__](https://bookdown.org/ndphillips/YaRrr/) for an alternative treatment to the logic of functions
* [Debugging](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/debugging.html) section in [__Advanced R__](https://adv-r.hadley.nz) to learn how to find and fix errors when building a function (and when programming in general)
* [Defensive Programming](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Exceptions-Debugging.html#defensive-programming) section in [__Advanced R__](http://adv-r.had.co.nz) to get you acquainted with the logic of making code fail in well-defined manners
