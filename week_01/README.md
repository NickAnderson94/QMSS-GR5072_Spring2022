## Week 1: Introduction

### Before our first class...

There are a few **mandatory** things to be prepared for our first class:

1. Install [__R__](https://cran.r-project.org) and [__RStudio__](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) on your computer.   
2. Read through [__R-Tutorial__](http://www.r-tutor.com/r-introduction) - each subsection in R Introduction including [Basic Data Types](http://www.r-tutor.com/r-introduction/basic-data-types), [Vector](http://www.r-tutor.com/r-introduction/vector), [Matrix](http://www.r-tutor.com/r-introduction/matrix), [List](http://www.r-tutor.com/r-introduction/list), and [Data Frame](http://www.r-tutor.com/r-introduction/data-frame)

### Complementary Resources

#### R (p)re-fresher

If you are taking this course, you are probably not new to R. But if you need a handy refresher, make sure to revisit some of these resources:

* [__An Introduction to R__](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-intro.pdf) gives a longer and more detailed introduction to the language.
* [__Hands-on Programming with R__](https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/) compiles a more detailed - yet friendly - introduction to R for first-time programmers.
* [__YaRrr! The Pirate's Guide to R__](https://bookdown.org/ndphillips/YaRrr/who-is-this-book-for.html) a more extensive introduction to the basics of R.


#### Advanced R resources

Even if you're not new to R, you may have started to encounter things you simply cannot understand. Do not despair, there is a way out of the [__The R Inferno__](http://www.burns-stat.com/pages/Tutor/R_inferno.pdf). If you want to delve deeper into the inner structure and logic of R to improve your code, make sure to consult the first few chapters of [__Advanced R__](https://adv-r.hadley.nz). If you're interested in learning "tricks of the trade" to help you form good programming habits, make sure to consult [__Efficient R Programming__](https://csgillespie.github.io/efficientR/).

#### All-terrain R Resources

* [__IDRE__](https://stats.idre.ucla.edu/r/) (at UCLA): great resource for tutorials, FAQs, code examples, class notes, and other useful materials for R
* [__Awesome-R__](https://github.com/qinwf/awesome-R): a curated list of great R packages and tools
* [__RStudio cheatsheets__](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/): useful single-page reference guides for all sorts of R packages and base functions
* [__R-bloggers__](https://www.r-bloggers.com): to keep up to date with the latest R news from the R community
* [__Rseek__](https://rseek.org): a search engine for R-related stuff, including tutorials and code
* [__CRAN__](https://cran.r-project.org): the official hub for all things R


#### All-terrain coding resources

* [__Google__](https://www.google.comsta): yes, if you haven't figured it out in 5 minutes, Google it!
* [__Stackoverflow__](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r): a collaborative platform to ask coding questions and get/provide answers. If you've thought about it, probably someone has solved it before and posted it in Stackoverflow. _Pro Tip:_ Include the tag ``[r]`` on your search for R-specific answers
