This repository is a companion to the course [__Modern Data Structures__](https://vergil.registrar.columbia.edu/#/courses/QMSSG5072_001_2022_1) taught at the [__Quantitative Methods in the Social Sciences__](http://qmss.columbia.edu/) program over the Spring of 2022. It contains curated reference materials, slides and sample code. You can find the most updated version of the course syllabus [__here__](/syllabus/GR5072_Spring2022.pdf). Make sure to check regularly for updates.

The course will primarily use the [__R__](https://www.r-project.org) language for instruction. For that reason, some familiarity with R — in particular with regards the logic of object-oriented programming languages and base functions — is assumed. Knowledge of specific packages and other software tools will be built throughout the course.
