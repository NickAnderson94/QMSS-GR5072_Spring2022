This repository is a companion to the course [__Modern Data Structures__](https://vergil.registrar.columbia.edu/#/courses/QMSSG5072_001_2022_1) taught at the [__Quantitative Methods in the Social Sciences__](http://qmss.columbia.edu/) program over the Spring of 2022. It contains curated reference materials, slides and sample code. You can find the most updated version of the course syllabus [__here__](/syllabus/GR5072_Spring2022.pdf). Make sure to check regularly for updates.

The course will primarily use the [__R__](https://www.r-project.org) language for instruction. For that reason, some familiarity with R — in particular with regards the logic of object-oriented programming languages and base functions — is assumed. Knowledge of specific packages and other software tools will be built throughout the course.


### Resources

* __Textbooks:__ While there are no required textbooks for this course, you will find these (online) books to be very useful in addition to the lectures and course readings:

	* Hadley Wickham & Garret Grolemund. [__R for Data Science__](https://r4ds.had.co.nz). O’Reilly Media, Boston, MA, 2016
	* Hadley Wickham. [__Advanced R__](https://adv-r.hadley.nz) (Second Edition). Taylor & Francis Group, Boca Raton, FL, 2019
